1. Number: Any numerical value (e.g., integers, floats).

4. Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not initialized.
5. Null: An intentional absence of any value.
6. Symbol: A unique and immutable value, primarily used as object keys.
7. BigInt: A large integer type for representing values greater than 2^53-1.
